 I am delighted to share the Excel, Power BI, And Tableau Dashboard using Olist Ecommerce Store Data.
 
 Project name: Olist Store Analysis
 Domain: E-commerce
 Tools: Excel, Power BI, Tableau, MySQL
 
Description - In this project, I validated and analyzed the business of the Olist E-commerce Store with the help of KPI metrics and visual charts using tools like MS Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL. Based on the Requirement of the client we have developed the visualization.
 
Project Overview:
 The Olist Store Analysis project aims to analyze customer purchasing patterns and payment statistics on an E-commerce platform, Olist. 

 Data Exploration and Cleaning:
 The analysis is based on 9 CSV files cleaned and manipulated to extract valuable insights. Identify missing and duplicate values in each dataset and treat them accordingly. Also, all data quality issues associated with the dataset should be treated.
 
Data Visualization:
Create appropriate visualizations to identify the most ordered products by payment statistics and purchasing patterns.


1. Key Insights
Payment Types:
Credit card payments dominate with 109k transactions, while vouchers are the least used. This insight suggests a focus on promoting less-used payment methods.
Sales Distribution:
Weekday sales are significantly higher than weekend sales, indicating a preference for weekday shopping. Marketing efforts could target weekends to boost sales.
Top Performing Cities:
Befe is the top-performing city with 3260 in sales value. Understanding why certain cities perform better can help replicate success in other areas.
Product Performance:
Beleza_saude is the leading product category with 13k orders. Investing in inventory and marketing for top products can maximize sales.

2. Suggestions
Focus on Weekdays:
Since most sales occur on weekdays, consider running promotions or special offers to boost weekend sales, balancing out sales distribution.
Expand Top Products:
Increase inventory and marketing efforts for top product categories to capitalize on their popularity and drive higher sales.
Payment Options:
Encourage underutilized payment methods like vouchers to diversify payment types, potentially increasing overall sales.

3. Conclusion
The Olist Store Analysis Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of our store's performance. By leveraging data analysis and visualization tools in Excel and Power Query, we can make informed decisions to drive business growth. This dashboard is a powerful tool for understanding our market, optimizing strategies, and achieving our goals.
